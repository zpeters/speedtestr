# Speedtestr

Speedtestr is an opensource project to attempt to reverse engineer parts of the publically available speedtest.net system in order to create an unofficial command-line client.

The advantage of using the speedtest infrastructure is that as the end-user there is nothing to install, setup or maintain.  You just need to run the speedtestr client app.

Since this is an unofficial client using *unsupported* methods to test speeds it is possible this **completely innaccurate** and there is nothing I can do about that.  It is very possible that at any moment the *tricks* that are used to get speed test results could go away so *DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS FOR ANYTHING MISSION CRITICAL!!!*

This is just a fun skill-building exercise
